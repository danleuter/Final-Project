            <p>A visit to the town of Samboan in southern Cebu is not complete without experiencing the adventures offered by <strong>Aguinid Falls</strong>.</p>
            <p>Aguinid Falls is one of more than 11 waterfalls of the town of Samboan and perhaps the most popular of them all. It lies along the calcium-rich Tangbo River making the water beautifully turquoise and warm.</p>

            <p>Aguinid Falls is a multi-layer cascade with the first five levels accessible to general public with a guide. The entire journey involves upstream river trekking and rappelling, and will need one to climb walls, rocks and boulders. Be not afraid for it is generally an easy feat with the help of your guide.</p>
            <p>The first level is around 15 minutes from the trailhead which features a small cascade and a natural pool with a passage on the side that leads to the next level. The nearby second level is a 30-meter high slanted wall that needs to be climbed to advance to upper levels; rockholes, rope and assistance of the guide make the climb easy. The third level features a cavern while the fourth level is where one can jump off to a small pool approximately six feet deep.</p>

            <p>But the highlight of Aguinid Falls is the fifth level with a towering 25-meter wall made up of mushroom-like rock formations and a shallow turquoise-colored natural pool. Go climb the wall and experience the natural massage of flowing water!</p>
            <p>Beyond the fifth level are few more cascades (at least three more) which are generally offbeat and less appealing than the fifth.</p>

            <p>It takes around 45 minutes to get to the fifth level from the base on an adventure that will surely make you wet, so make sure to waterproof your stuff.</p>
            <p>If you are craving for more waterfalling adventure, check out Binalayan and Dao Falls, both located in the town of Samboan.</p>
